##  Knowledge Base

### Plant classes (5)
| Class | Main criteria | Watering |
|-------|---------------|----------|

| Tropical | Thin leaves, high humidity | 1×/week |
| Cactus | Round shape, small size | 1×/month |
| Orchid | Flowers, low light | Variable |
| Herbaceous | Medium leaves, medium light | 2×/week |

### Inference rules (15)
- **R1-R5**: Classification by plant type
- **R6-R10**: Watering frequency determination
- **R11-R15**: Identification of necessary precautions

### Available diagnostics
- Overwatering (soft leaves)
- Underwatering (dry leaves)
- Fungal problem (spotted leaves)
- Repotting needed (visible roots)
